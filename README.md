# StopCar - v1.0
| PHP v7.0 | MySQL |
|----------|-------|

System made for a mechanic workshop, with the main objective being to search for the license plate and check which services were done.

## Frameworks, libraries and icons
- The system is being developed fully responsive, using the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework.
- The icons are used from the [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) font pack, in which the free version pack is used.
- Sending mail uses the [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer) library.
- For dynamic changes and some other functions I style the [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) JavaScript library.
- And the dashboard charts are generated with the other JavaScript library [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

### Future
I intend to try to continue working on system updates, adding features, improvements and fixing problems, even more if the GitHub community helps, we can do it even better and more complete. ðŸ˜€

Thank you!
